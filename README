=====================

status
------
    * PyMPD was written a while ago and is no longer being
      actively maintained/developed.  No efforts will be made
      to keep up with changes/additions to MPD's protocol.  It
      works at the moment, though.

    * It was long enough ago that I'im not sure what the difference
      between version 1 and 2 is - both probably work though.

usage
-----
    >>> import mpd
    >>> m = mpd.MPD() # or m = mpd.MPD(host='127.0.0.1', port=6600)
    >>> m.status()
        ...data sent back...
    >>> m.find('artist Disturbed')
        ...data sent back...
